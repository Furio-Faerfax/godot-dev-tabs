# godot-dev-tabs
This utility tool, is made to make development of games easier.
It allows to toggle of and on a mode to view the Game in the dev/game mode, in devmode, you can switch between tabs to navigate thgrough the tool.
currently planned a note taking plane and a gdd(or other documents) view/editor, to support quick access without switching between apps

If you want to use this tool, just start with a fresh project and copy the folder dev_tabs and the settings script over, or just copy this project.
Depending on which mode you are in, in editor you can toggle the modes in the root node or ingame with f1(just note_mode), the game node will reparent to root/gametab
replace then the game node with your own game scene or use the game node to build up your game.

The curretn version does not have any features that are usefull, its just the barebone structure, the next update may hopefully contain some usefull features
